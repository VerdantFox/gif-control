# gif-control

Example for creating controllable gifs and controllable videos that behave like GIFs. Runs with simple flask app. Requires python > 3.6 and a flask installed (`pip install flask`). Run the flask app with `flask run`.

Freezable GIFs from library [freezeframe.js](https://github.com/ctrl-freaks/freezeframe.js/tree/master/packages/freezeframe). Video control idea from [this blog article](https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/).
